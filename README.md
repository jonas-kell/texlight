# texlight

Wrapper for pdflatex that includes a language server and other small features to create a backwards compatible super-set of the LaTeX language.

This is currently **experimental only - Nothing is yet documented and even working**. Do not use or get too high hopes...

## VS-Code Language client

A VS-Code extension can be found [Here](https://github.com/jonas-kell/texlight-vscode).

## dev

```shell
docker compose up
```

## compile wasm

```
